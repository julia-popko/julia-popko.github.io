  The inspiration for this project came from people around me. A lot of them experienced major difficulties while trying to organize a group meeting. I got curious about this topic and conducted some UX research to find out more about their painpoint. The biggest problem during organizing a group event turned out to be deciding and agreeing on specific meeting venue that would suit all the participants and their needs.

  Based on my research and competitors' analysis, I designed the project from the scratch to the hi-fidelity prototype. During the process, I tested my product to priorityze features to fill the Persona's needs, such a possiblity of adding a list of favorites places and a system of categories that will help to create a poll based on suggested places. I focused on finding a simple solution with a friendly, not overwhelmed with content interface.
