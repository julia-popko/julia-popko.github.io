     title="Introduction"
     content="The inspiration for this project came from people around me. A lot of them experienced major difficulties while trying to organize a group meeting. I got curious about this topic and conducted a major UX research to find out more about the problems. My challenge for this project was designing a responsive mobile application that help the user to plan and organize a meeting for a selected group of people."

     title="UX Research"
     content="Research showed that the biggest problem during organizing a group event is deciding and agreeing on a specific meeting venue that would suit all the participants and their needs. I conducted several interviews, in which people were complaining that the main reason of not coming for the meeting is the place - usually they don’t like it or it’s too far from the place where they live."

     content="
Based on my research and competitors’ analysis, I designed the project from the scratch to the hi-fidelity prototype. During the process, I tested my product to prioritize the features to fill the Persona’s needs, such a possiblity of adding a list of favorites places and a system of categories that will help to create a poll based on the suggested places. I focused on finding a simple solution with a friendly, not overwhelmed with the content interface with some playful elements."

My final product helps the user to organise meeting in four simple steps and to decide easily about the meeting venue thanks to the integrated system of categories and suggested places in the form of the poll. After voting, the meeting venue is set automatically and visible for all the guests. The final product also includes playful elements, such as the animation with the baloons.
