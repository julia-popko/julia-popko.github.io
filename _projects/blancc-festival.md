     content="Success of an event or a festival depends on two main factors: planning and promotion. The most effective way of connecting participants with their favorite festivals and artists is through a website. Nowadays an event’s digital presence is as important as the event itself — people can feel the vibe of it before it happens, learn what they will experience, and, most imporantingly, buy a ticket. For this project, I designed a responisive website for a pop music festival."

     content="During the UX research I found out that many music festival websites are lacking a clear information architecture and they are flooded with content and not consistent, which made it very hard for the users to navigate. Usually, the user visits the website of an event to check the line up and infromation about it. The primary goal is usually buying a festival ticket. During the design process and testing, the User Flow has been limited to a few easy steps that helps the user to achieve his goal."
