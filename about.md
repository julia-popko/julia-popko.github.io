Iâ€™m a Polish UX/UI designer with background in foreign languages. After graduating from the design bootcamp in Berlin, I moved back to Warsaw, where I currently work in the Design Team at PKO BP. I also do freelance projects.
I'm especially interested in user-centered and visual design. **Currently, I'm open for new challenging opportunities and collaborations, both stationary and remote.** I would feel great as a part of international environment and enjoy working with motivated and creative people.
