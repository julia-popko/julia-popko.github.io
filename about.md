Currently working as a UI designer as a part of the international team in the Digital Experience Group atÂ [Wolters Kluwer](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/){:target="_blank"} in Warsaw.

Before, together with my Design Team, I was building a Design System for the biggest Polish Bank, [PKO BP](https://https://www.pkobp.pl/){:target="_blank"}

I graduated from [Ironhack](https://ironhack.com/){:target="_blank"} in Berlin, which I did to develop my career in tech field.
I also have a university degree in French and English.

I'm especially interested in user-centered and visual design. I'm always open for new challenging opportunities and collaborations, both stationary and remote. I feel great as a part of international environment and enjoy working with motivated and creative people.
