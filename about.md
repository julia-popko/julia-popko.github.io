text_about: >-
  I am a UI/UX Designer passionate about detail-oriented and user-centered design, with special interest in visual design. I have a background in foreign languages -  during past years I studied at Warsaw and Hamburg University - foreign languages and studing abroad helped me to be become a multi-tasker and to easily communicate with people from different environments. Then, I moved to the the capital of Germany to fullfil my dream about working with people and for people - to become a UX/UI designer. I learned design at Ironhack full-time design bootcamp. I'm currently looking for new job opportunities in the beautiful city of Berlin. Here you can find my resume.
