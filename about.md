Currently working as a UI designer as a part of the Design Team atÂ [PKO BP](https://www.pkobp.pl/){:target="_blank"} in Warsaw.

I graduated from [Ironhack](https://ironhack.com/){:target="_blank"} in Berlin, which I did to develop my career in tech field.
I also have a university degree in French and English.

I'm especially interested in user-centered and visual design. Currently, I'm open for new challenging opportunities and collaborations, both stationary and remote. I would feel great as a part of international environment and would enjoy working with motivated and creative people.
